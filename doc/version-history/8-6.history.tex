\section{\label{sec:History-8-6}Stable Release Series 8.6}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This is a stable release series of HTCondor.
As usual, only bug fixes (and potentially, ports to new platforms)
will be provided in future 8.6.x releases.
New features will be added in the 8.7.x development series.

The details of each version are described below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-6-2}Version 8.6.2}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.6.2 not yet released.
%\item HTCondor version 8.6.2 released on Month Date, 2017.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item When the \Condor{credd} is polling for credentials, the timeout is now
configurable using \Macro{CREDD\_POLLING\_TIMEOUT}.

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item The default values for \MacroNI{HAD\_SOCKET\_NAME} and
\MacroNI{REPLICATION\_SOCKET\_NAME} have changed to enable the documented
configuration for using these services with shared port to work.
\Ticket{6186}

\item Fixed a bug that caused \Condor{dagman} to sometimes (rarely, but
repeatably) crash when parsing DAGs containing splices.
\Ticket{6170}

\item The configuration parameters that control when job policy expressions
are evaluated now work as documented.
Previously, the default value for \MacroNI{PERIODIC\_EXPR\_INTERVAL} was
300, not 60 as intended.
Also, the parameters \MacroNI{MAX\_PERIODIC\_EXPR\_INTERVAL} and
\MacroNI{PERIODIC\_EXPR\_TIMESLICE} were ignored for grid universe jobs.
\Ticket{6199}

\item Fixed a bug that prevented \MacroNI{SUBMIT\_REQUIREMENT} and
\MacroNI{JOB\_TRANSFORM} expressions from referencing job attributes
describing the job's X.509 proxy credential.
\Ticket{6188}

\item Fixed a bug that could cause \Condor{store\_cred} to fail on
Windows due to a case-sensitive check of the user's account name.
\Ticket{6200}

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-6-1}Version 8.6.1}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.6.1 released on March 2, 2017.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item \Condor{q} now checks to see if authentication and security negotiation are enabled before attempting to
request only the current users jobs from the \Condor{schedd}.  Prior to this change, configurations that disabled
security or authentication would also need to set \Macro{CONDOR\_Q\_ONLY\_MY\_JOBS} to false.
\Ticket{6125}

\item The CLAIMTOBE authentication method is now in the list of methods for READ access if no list of
authentication methods for READ or DEFAULT is specified in the configuration.  This change allows sites that
use the default host based security model to use \Condor{q} \Opt{-global} with the only-my-jobs feature
without making changes to their security configuration.
\Ticket{6125}

\item The collector now records the authentication method used to determine the authenticated identity.
\Ticket{6122}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Update Docker interface to be able to retrieve usage information
from running containers and to remove containers when certain errors
occurred when using Docker version 1.13.
\Ticket{6088}

\item In Docker universe, all writes to files in \File{/tmp} and \File{/var/tmp} by default
write inside the container.  There is a limit on the file size within the container,
and jobs that write a lot to \File{/tmp} may hit that.  If a docker universe job now runs
on a system with \MacroNI{MOUNT\_UNDER\_SCRATCH} defined, HTCondor now adds those
mounts as volume mounts, so file writes do not go to the container, but to the host
file system.
\Ticket{6080}

\item Fixed a bug in \Condor{status} \Opt{-format} and \Condor{q} \Opt{-format} that caused the
tools to truncate output to the width specified in the format specifier. The most likely manifestation of
this bug was that punctuation after the format would not be printed when the format had an explicit width.
\Ticket{6120}

\item Fixed a bug that caused spurious shared port-related error
messages to appear in the \File{dagman.out} file (by adding the
new \MacroNI{DAGMAN\_USE\_SHARED\_PORT} configuration macro).
\Ticket{6156}

\item Fixed a bug that caused VM universe jobs to fail if the
\SubmitCmdNI{vm\_disk} submit command contained spaces after a comma.
\Ticket{6132}

\item Fixed a bug that can cause the Job Router and \Condor{c-gahp} to
crash if they fail to submit a job due to submit transforms or
submit requirements.
\Ticket{6152}

\item Fixed a bug that caused the Job Router to not route any jobs if
the \MacroNI{JOB\_ROUTER\_DEFAULTS} configuration parameter value
started with white space.
\Ticket{6128}

\item Fixed several bugs in how the Job Router writes to job event logs.
\Ticket{6092}

\item Removed Bosco's attempt to configure a default value for
\SubmitCmdNI{grid\_resource} in the submit description file, as
\Condor{submit} no longer supports this ability.
Also, Bosco now works with Slurm clusters.
\Ticket{6106}

\item Changed Bosco's configuration of the \condor{ft-gahp} to eliminate
worrying error messages in the \condor{ft-gahp}'s log file.
\Ticket{6107}

\item Fixed a bug that could cause a grid batch job submitted to PBS or
Slurm to go on hold when the job's X.509 proxy is refreshed.
\Ticket{6136}

\item Fixed a bug where the \Condor{gridmanager} fails to put a job on
hold due to the desired hold reason containing invalid characters.
\Ticket{6142}

\item Improved the hold reason when submission of a grid-type batch
job fails.
\Ticket{3377}

\item Update helper scripts to work with current versions of Open MPI and MPICH2.
\Ticket{6024}

\item Fixes a bug that could cause events for local universe jobs to not
be written to the global event log.
\Ticket{6100}

\item Fixed a bug on execute machines that enable PID namespaces that
would generate a spurious error message in the daemon log when condor\_off -fast was issued.
\Ticket{6137}

\item Fixed a bug that could corrupt the job queue log file such that
the \Condor{schedd} cannot restart.
The bug is mostly likely to occur if the disk becomes full.
\Ticket{6153}

\item Incremented the ClassAd library version number, since the deprecated
iostream interface has been removed.
\Ticket{6050}
\Ticket{6115}

\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{\label{sec:New-8-6-0}Version 8.6.0}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent Release Notes:

\begin{itemize}

\item HTCondor version 8.6.0 released on January 26, 2017.

\end{itemize}


\noindent New Features:

\begin{itemize}

\item Added two new job ClassAd attributes, \MacroNI{CumulativeRemoteSysCpu} and
\MacroNI{CumulativeRemoteUserCpu}, which keep a running total of system and user
CPU usage, respectively, across all job restarts.  Also, immediately clear attributes
\MacroNI{RemoteSysCpu} and \MacroNI{RemoveUserCpu} on job start, instead of on first update.
\Ticket{6022}

\item Added a new configuration knob, \MacroNI{ALWAYS\_REUSEADDR}, which defaults
to \Expr{True}.  When \Expr{True}, it tells HTCondor to set the
\MacroNI{SO\_REUSEADDR} socket option, so that
the schedd can run large numbers of very short jobs without exhausting the
number of local ports needed for shadows.
\Ticket{6040}

\item Changed the default value of \MacroNI{IGNORE\_LEAF\_OOM} to \Expr{True}.
\Ticket{5775}

\end{itemize}

\noindent Bugs Fixed:

\begin{itemize}

\item Fixed a bug causing unnecessarily slow updates from the \Condor{startd}.
If you depend on the old behavior, set \MacroNI{UPDATE\_SPREAD\_TIME} to 8.  A
value of 0 enables the fix.
\Ticket{6062}

\item Fixed a race condition when running multiple concurrent jobs on the same claim.
When the starter exits, it notifies the shadow, which tells the startd to kill the starter.
Immediately after the shadows tells the startd, it fetches the next job, and tries to start it.
If the starter hasn't completely exited yet (perhaps it needs to clean up a large sandbox),
it will notice the shadow has closed the command socket, and the starter will go into disconnected
mode, and get confused.  This has been fixed.
\Ticket{6049}

\item Fixed an infelicity with \Condor{submit} -i and docker universe,
where it would start an interactive shell without a container.  Added error
message expressing that this combination is not currently supported.
\Ticket{6083}

\item When a job claimed by the Job Router is held or removed, it is no
longer considered a failure of the job route chosen for that job.
\Ticket{5968}

\item Fixed a bug in recovering a Google Compute Engine (GCE) job if the
\Condor{gridmanager} restarts during submission of the instance request.
\Ticket{6078}

\item Fixed a bug that could cause re-installation of a remote cluster
to fail in Bosco.
\Ticket{6042}

\item Fixed a bug with handling the proxy files of grid-type batch jobs
when the proxy's file name is a relative path.
\Ticket{6053}

\item Fixed a bug that caused the \Prog{batch\_gahp} to crash when a job's
X.509 proxy is refreshed and the \Prog{batch\_gahp} is configured to not
create a limited copy of the proxy.
\Ticket{6051}

\item Fixed a bug in the virtual machine universe where \Attr{RequestMemory}
and \Attr{RequestCPUs} were not changing the resources assigned to the VM
created by HTCondor.  Now, \Attr{VM\_Memory} defaults to \Attr{RequestMemory},
and the number of CPUs defaults to \Attr{RequestCPUs}.
\Ticket{5998}

\end{itemize}
